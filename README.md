<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Main Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212383699191070801/1281173605517885463/image.png?ex=66dac166&is=66d96fe6&hm=9a0d0bd1c4bc712195acf1c25a912c46ec0e1f99212f4f46c45eb1671e59248f&)

HoI Ultimate Bravery is an external program allowing you to randomly generate unit types such as tanks/planes/boats as well as the divisions themselves. For now it only work with the base game (will all the DLC, maybe ?) and in the futur i will include the support of generating unit for mod.
You can choose the nations which will have the right to have these units but there is a small catch: you cannot, inside the game, change/edit the units or divisions you have generated.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The UI is divided in two part:
On the left you have the buttons to navigate through the different menus
On the right you have a box where the different elements are located to generate your units

The first thing you'll need to do is to set the game path in the options
(don't mind the language options, it can broke the whole thing)

You can now go to Generate, you can choose the unit type on the left and the unit subtype
![Generate Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212383699191070801/1212383709949337650/image.png?ex=66d9ab51&is=66d859d1&hm=83f43d4f345a73fcbf175f4708a8bd823332c7a9ac93e4f7e6a320ee3be3f189&)You can choose the nation you want to play and generate the units you want or do it for all the nations present in the selection by checking the box

When you click on the type you want to generate you get this
![Generation Window](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212383699191070801/1212385828504997888/image.png?ex=66d9ad4a&is=66d85bca&hm=15b023aa03eee74c2c5c8ce2d7107faf885a336b708dddb40011d286acde2379&)
You can go back or regenerate

When you are on import page you can select wich countries you want to import or just click the checkbox for all countries.
![Import Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1212383699191070801/1212401969868574810/image.png?ex=66d91392&is=66d7c212&hm=dd0e1b6bc3cca909f1a9fc0a1591cc2ac9fab5f3afb6212b010c529e35acd990&)
You'll need to import before starting the game and be ultra careful to reset file before quitting the program else you are good to do a steam verif of your game.
